            </h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               Back in the fall of 2019, I found myself with a haircut that seemed irreparable. 
               Faced with desperation, I made a spontaneous trip to Great Clips, where I opted to have my hair shaved in the hopes of 
               salvaging some semblance of style. To my surprise, I discovered a newfound sense of liberation and convenience with 
               the absence of hair, prompting me to maintain the same style ever since. As the tumultuous year of 2020 unfolded with the 
               onset of the pandemic, I took matters into my own hands and began to master the art of self-haircutting.

            <h2 >&#9672;Why I Will Never Grow Out My Hair Again&#9672;

            </h2>
            <p><i>"When are you growing your hair back out?"</i></p>
            <p><i>"Men like long hair!"</i></p>
            <p><i>"Why would you do that?"</i></p>
            <p> 
               These questions echo in my daily interactions. Once, in the past five years, I let my hair grow, 
               only to cut it all off again. The notion of having hair now feels peculiar. The laborious upkeep, 
               the awkward transition phases, and the constant maintenance are all headache-inducing.</p>
            <p>
               Being bald elevates my confidence to unprecedented heights. Embracing individuality, eschewing trends, 
               and enjoying the simplicity of waking up without a hair routine are liberating. I've discovered myself 
               with short hair and doubt I'll ever turn back. </p>
