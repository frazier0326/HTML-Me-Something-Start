4TH SECTION
//Why I will never grow out my hair again//

"When are you growing your hair back out?"
"Men will long hair"
"Why would you do that?"

These are questions I am asked everyday by others. I've gone my hair out once within the past 
five years I have cut my hair and ended up cutting it all back off. The idea of myself with 
hair just seems weird. The effort to put into my hair, the awkward grow out phase, the maintenance
all give me a headache. 
Having my head bald boosts my confidence to an all time high. Not following trends, being an
individual, and rolling out of bed with no hair routine is great! I found myself with my short 
hair and will probably never go back.
